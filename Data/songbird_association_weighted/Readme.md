**Study description**|**value**
Species|*Haemorhous mexicanus*
Taxonomic class|Aves
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Virginia Tech, Virginia, USA
Data collection technique|RFID
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction|A machine learning algorithm was applied to identify clusters of detections on feeders. Next, the network was generated based on patterns of co-occurrence by individuals in the same feeding events. Asociations between birds were defined using the simple ratio index.
